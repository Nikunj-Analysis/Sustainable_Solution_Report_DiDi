Sustainable Solutions Report for DiDi – Business Research & Innovation

As part of my Business Research Design coursework, I collaborated with my team—Arunesh Tajane, Jaya Harris Sivakumar, Aiswarya Muraleedharan Nair, and myself (Nikunj Gupta)—to develop an innovative and sustainable solution for a real-world challenge faced by DiDi, a leading rideshare company. Our project focused on improving accessibility for passengers with disabilities, particularly those using service animals, by addressing systemic barriers in the rideshare industry.

Our research-driven approach involved primary data collection through in-depth interviews and focus groups, allowing us to develop an empathy map and consolidate insights from key stakeholders. Using design thinking methodologies, we crafted customer-centered solutions aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring social, economic, and environmental sustainability.

Key Outcomes:

✅ Conducted extensive research on accessibility challenges in ridesharing

✅ Developed innovative solutions: Driver Incentives, Priority Booking, and Voice Assistant Integration

✅ Proposed a structured implementation timeline for solution rollout

✅ Created a comprehensive digital report demonstrating strategic thinking and problem-solving

✅ Presented our solution via a video pitch, showcasing digital fluency and teamwork
